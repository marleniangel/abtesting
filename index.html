    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Does a certain version of an appointment scheduling web page with modified contrast, spacing, and colors allow different groups of users to complete tasks differently or more quickly? With the use of A/B testing, I will aim to discover whether one version of a webpage produces different user results than another using t-tests. Can a different design of a webpage determine how quickly users are able to navigate through a similar task?

                <h3>Metric of my choice</h3>
                <p>
                    My metric of choice is time to first click. I feel that this metric will help me reveal any hints toward whether users felt more confident using one site over another based on the time it took them to make their first click. 
                </p>

                <h3>Hypotheses & Predictions</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>Misclick Rate</h4>

Null hypothesis: The misclick rate is the same for both designs. 
<br>
Alternative hypothesis: The misclick rate for version A is higher than the misclick rate of version B. 
<br>
<br>
Justification for alternative hypothesis: I hypothesize that the misclick rate on the webpage for version A is higher than the misclick rate  on the webpage for version B because of the low contrast issues on the button options. Since the text is very hard to distinguish and the buttons are not spaced out, I hypothesize that users might have trouble finding the correct option to select and will misclick more times on version A than on version B. 
<br>
<br>
Prediction: I predict that the null hypothesis will be rejected because of the low contrast and button spacing issues on the webpage for version A. 
<h4>Time on page</h4>
Null hypothesis: The time spent on the webpage is the same for both designs. 
<br>
Alternative hypothesis: The time spent on the webpage for Version A is higher than the time spent on the webpage of Version B.
<br> 
<br>
Justification for alternative hypothesis: I hypothesize that the time spent on the webpage for version A is higher than the time spent on the webpage for version B because of the low contrast issues on the button options. Since the text is very hard to distinguish and the buttons are not spaced out, I hypothesize that the time spent on version A will be longer since users might have trouble finding the correct option to select. 
<br>
<br>
Prediction: I predict that the null hypothesis will be rejected because of the low contrast and button spacing issues on the webpage for version A. 
<h4>Time to first click</h4>
Null hypothesis: The time spent to first click is the same for both designs. 
<br>
Alternative hypothesis: The time spent to first click for Version A is higher than the time spent to first click for Version B. 
<br>
<br>
Justification for alternative hypothesis: I hypothesize that the time to first click on the webpage for version A is higher than the time to first click on the webpage for version B. Since the text is very hard to distinguish and the buttons are not spaced out, I hypothesize that users might have trouble finding the correct option to select and will spend more time trying to figure out which button to press on version A than on version B.
<br> 
<br>
Prediction: I predict that the null hypothesis will be rejected because of the low contrast and button spacing issues on the webpage for version A.

                <h5> Description of test</h5>
                <p>One-tailed t-test:The one-tailed t-test shows whether x (experimental) number is bigger/smaller than y (baseline) number. Since my alternative hypothesis states that the the misclick rate on the webpage for version A is higher than the misclick rate  on the webpage for version b, I need a test that will be able to reveal whether my x, version b, is bigger or smaller than my y, version a. 
                </p>
                <h5> Statistical significance</h5>
                <p> 0.19899059153 > 0.05
                    <br>
                    The p-value (0.19899059153)  is not less than the significance level (0.05), therefore, the difference between versions A and B with respect to the misclick rate metric is statistically insignificant. 
                    </p>
                <h5> P-value</h5>

                <p> 0.00184922196 < 0.05

                    The p-value (0.00184922196)  is less than the significance level (0.05), therefore, the difference between versions A and B with respect to the time on page metric is statistically significant.

                    The p-value (0.00103670626)  is less than the significance level (0.05), therefore, the difference between versions A and B with respect to the time to first click metric is statistically significant.

                    <p> *P-value description relevant for all of my tests* 
                        <br>
                        Since the calculator (for one-tailed tests) strictly calculates the p-value relating to sample As' values being less than sample Bs' values, I had to correct the outputted p-value since all my hypotheses state that sample As' values will be greater than sample Bs' values. The p-value appropriate for this chosen hypothesis is the complement of the p-value the calculator gives. *taken from Ed Post #153

                        <h3> Summary Statistics</h3>
                        <p>Test 2:
                            <br> 
                            Avg(A) = 22324.78261 â‰… 22 seconds 
                            <br>
                            Avg(B) = 11210.6 â‰… 11 seconds 
                            <br>
                            
                            Test 3: 
                            <br>
                            Avg(A) = 12217.42857 â‰… 12 seconds
                            <br> 
                            Avg(B) = 6762.210526 â‰… 6 seconds 
                            <br>
                            
                            
                            
                            Based on tests 2 and 3, it is likely that version B is better than version A!
                            I see that on average people spend 11 more seconds on the version A webpage, and 6 more seconds before clicking on something on it. Analysis shows that itâ€™s likely a true difference. I think that this difference is because of version A's low contrast issues of the text on the buttons, the spacing of the buttons, and the lack of font sizing and color on appointment details. It seems that users more efficiently select what they need to on version B than on version a.
